## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned how to overcome some challenges with positioning, margins and how to create small button animations using just HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

In the process of continuing to develop my skills, I intend to focus on deepening use of FlexBox and the precision of responsiveness.
